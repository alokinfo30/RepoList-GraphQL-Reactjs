# RepoList-GraphQL-Reactjs
This project is a simple web application that allows users to view a list of repositories from GitHub. The application is built using Reactjs and GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language that allows users to specify exactly the data they want to retrieve from the server. This makes it a good fit for building data-intensive applications like Repo List.
